Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Product Name

Ephemeral Chat Rooms

1. Purpose & Vision

The goal of this product is to provide a simple, frictionless, and privacy-focused chat application that allows users to create and join chat rooms instantly without authentication or signup.

All chat rooms are temporary, existing for one hour only, after which they are automatically destroyed along with all associated data.

The product prioritizes:

Speed

Simplicity

Privacy

Zero onboarding friction

2. Problem Statement

Most chat applications require:

User accounts

Email verification

Persistent data storage

These requirements introduce friction for users who simply want a quick, temporary conversation space.

There is a need for a disposable chat solution where:

Anyone can start a room instantly

Links can be shared easily

No data is retained long-term

3. Target Users

Individuals who want quick, temporary discussions

Teams needing short-lived collaboration spaces

Study groups or interview sessions

Ad-hoc meetings without setup overhead

4. Key Product Principles

No authentication: Users never create accounts

Ephemeral by design: All data expires automatically

Room-scoped identity: Display names only exist inside a room

Single-purpose: Focused purely on chat

Minimal infrastructure: Easy to deploy and operate

5. Functional Requirements
5.1 Room Creation

Any visitor can create a new chat room

Server generates a unique room_id

Room has:

created_at timestamp

expires_at timestamp (exactly 1 hour later)

User is redirected to the room URL upon creation

Example URL

/room/abc123

5.2 Joining a Room

Anyone with the room link can join

On first entry, user provides a display name

No identity verification or persistence across rooms

Display name is only valid within the current room

5.3 Messaging

Real-time messaging using WebSockets

Messages contain:

Sender display name

Message content

Timestamp

Messages are broadcast instantly to all connected participants

Messages may be stored temporarily to allow page refresh recovery

5.4 Room Expiration

Each room automatically expires after 1 hour

On expiration:

All connected users are disconnected

Room becomes inaccessible

All messages and metadata are deleted

Users are notified that the room has expired and redirected

No room data persists beyond its expiration.

5.5 Room Countdown (UX Requirement)

Users can see remaining time before room expiration

Countdown updates in real time

Optional warning when less than 5 minutes remain

6. Non-Functional Requirements
6.1 Performance

Messages should be delivered with minimal latency

Application should handle multiple concurrent rooms on a single server

6.2 Data Retention & Privacy

SQLite is used only for short-lived persistence

No data is retained beyond room expiration

Database remains small and self-cleaning

6.3 Reliability

Expired rooms must be cleaned up reliably

Server restarts should not resurrect expired rooms

Cleanup process runs automatically in the background

7. Technical Architecture
7.1 Backend

Framework: FastAPI

Responsibilities:

Room creation and validation

WebSocket handling for chat

Room expiration and cleanup

WebSocket connections manage live messaging

In-memory state tracks connected participants

SQLite stores room metadata and optional message history

7.2 Frontend

Framework: Vue 3

Single Page Application (SPA)

Routes:

/ → Create room

/room/:id → Chat room

Vue app is built and served directly by FastAPI

7.3 Deployment Model

Single-server deployment

Vue static build mounted on FastAPI

FastAPI serves:

REST APIs (/api/*)

WebSockets (/ws/*)

Vue static assets and SPA routes

No CORS configuration required

8. Cleanup & Expiration Strategy

Background task runs every 30–60 seconds

Identifies rooms where expires_at <= current_time

Performs:

Deletion of room records

Deletion of all associated messages

Disconnection of active WebSocket clients

9. Constraints & Assumptions

No user authentication

No external services (Redis, Postgres, etc.)

Single-instance deployment

No horizontal scaling

Rooms are not recoverable once expired

10. Out of Scope

User accounts

Moderation or reporting tools

File uploads

Search or analytics

Long-term message history

Voice or video chat

11. Success Metrics

Users can create a room in under 2 seconds

Messages are delivered in real time with minimal delay

Rooms expire exactly after 1 hour

No expired data remains in the system

Application is easy to deploy and maintain

12. Future Considerations (Not Required)

Optional room password

Redis-based scaling

WebRTC integration

Shorter or configurable room durations
